  inspectMessage:
  - It's a fish bone. I wonder if I can put this in anything.
  - "I pull a long, thin fishbone out of the fish\u2019s cavity. Looks like a lockpick
    from my set over at the precinct."
  - 
  - 'I jiggle the bone in the lock and give it a bit waggle. I scrape it against
    the internals of the lock and can clearly see it deteriorate with each wag. One
    sturdy push then, - click! That''s the good stuff right there. '
